# Npm lib seed

This project build base off [Babel Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/babel-starter-kit).
Original project version wasn't work well and fully applicable for me, and it seem as if it's not alive, so fixed some things and add some features for myself and made Closure Compiler compatible, so there's probably some differences.

> Npm lib seed is a project template for helping you easily bundle/debug/test/publish your Javascript libraries
